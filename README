dwm - dynamic window manager
============================
dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.

Changes
-------
The default tiled layout displays the master window on the right side, with the stack on the left.

Additionally, the master window will always remain the same size in tiling mode. It may still be switched to Monocle (fullscreen) mode using [MOD]-m when needed.

The reason for these changes was to allow the eyes to remain closer to the display center, rather than frequently at the left edge. Besides, text is more readable when it isn't full screen width.

NOTE: These changes were made using bakkeby's dwm-flexipatch as a starting point.

I have not run bakkeby's flexipatch-finalizer. The downside of this is that there is plenty of extra, dead code based on my particular patch selections in 'patches.h'.

The upside of this is that you may still choose your own preferred patches to include.
